1. Create a base class *Enemy.*
2. Inherit *Flying Enemy* and *Ground Enemy* classes from the base class *Enemy*.
3. Use member variables (data members) such as *health, attackPower, attackRange, XP, Level, etc.* in the *Enemy* class, *Flying Enemy and* *Ground Enemy.*
4. Implement getter and setter methods to respectively store or retrieve data from these variables in their respective classes.

5. Implement different member variables and member functions in each class depending upon the type of the enemy.
    For eg. the Flying enemy will have flyingRadius but the ground enemy will have patrollingRadius, likewise.
6. Implement cool functionalities in each enemy class, e.g implement the Fly() function in flying enemy and in that function print  funny/sarcastic/sexy looking messages on the console
