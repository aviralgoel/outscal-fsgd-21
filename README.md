# Full Stack Game Developement - 7 Months Apperenticeship at Outscal
 This repository holds my assignment submission and some self study programs (that is not part of official coursework). 
 
 **NOTE**: Not all my submissions are 100% correct. The purpose of this repository is not to act as a solution guide but to track my own personal progress. 
I encourage the reader to use my code only as inspiration/reference.
