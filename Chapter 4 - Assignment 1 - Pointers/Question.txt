1. Declare an integer variable 'Player Health' and initialize it with a value taken from user input.
2. Declare an integer pointer '*p*'.
3. Now store theÂ address of variable 'Player Health in pointer '*p*' using address operator(&).
4. Print the value of '*p*'.


5. Print the value stored in the variable 'Player Health' using the pointer '*p*' by using the access operator(*).
6. Print the value of the variable 'Player Health' directly and match it with the output got in step 5.
7. Change the value of 'Player Health' to something else,  by taking user input through pointer '*p'.*
